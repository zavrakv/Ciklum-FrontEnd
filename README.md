# Ciklum-FrontEnd

This client is hosted at http://207.154.201.232

To run client part you need to: 
1. Clone this project ```git clone https://github.com/zavrakv/Ciklum-FrontEnd.git``` and open it 
```cd Ciklum-FrontEnd```
2. Install all deps with ```npm install```. It will also install all ```bower components```
3. Build the project with ```grunt build```. ```npm start``` and serve it with ```grunt dev```. The last one will open your browser at
```localhost:3001```
4. For now all requests go to my hosted API http://207.154.201.232:3000, but you can change it in ```app/core/core.constants.js``` to 
localhost:3000, or whatever port you may be running on.
